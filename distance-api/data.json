It is the country's principal political, cultural, commercial, industrial, and transportation centre, sometimes described as the primate city of Hungary. According to 2011 Census, Budapest had 1.74 million inhabitants, down from its 1989 peak of 2.1 million due to suburbanization. The Budapest Commuter Area is home to 3.3 million people. The city covers an area of 525 square kilometres (202.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) within the city limits. Budapest became a single city occupying both banks of the river Danube with a unification on 17 November 1873 of west-bank Buda and \u00d3buda with east-bank Pest. The history of Budapest began with Aquincum, originally a Celtic settlement that became the Roman capital of Lower Pannonia. Hungarians arrived in the territory in the 9th century. Their first settlement was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241-42. The re-established town became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture in the 15th century. Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs and nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule, development of the region entered a new age of prosperity in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Budapest became a global city after the 1873 unification. It also became the second capital of Austria-Hungary, a great power that dissolved in 1918. After the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, when Hungary lost 72% of its former territory, culturally and economically the country became wholly Budapest-dominated. The capital dominates the country both by the size of its population\u2014which dwarfs those of Hungary's other cities Budapest was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, Operation Panzerfaust in 1944, the Battle of Budapest of 1945, and the Revolution of 1956. Cited as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, its extensive World Heritage Site includes the banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter, Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue, Heroes' Square and the Millennium Underground Railway, the second oldest in the world. Other highlights include a total of 80 geothermal springs, the world's largest thermal water cave system, second largest synagogue, and third largest Parliament building. The city attracts about 2.7 million tourists a year, making it the 37th most popular city in the world according to Euromonitor. Considered a financial hub in Central Europe, the city ranked 3rd (out of 65 cities) on Mastercard's Emerging Markets Index, and ranked as the most livable Central\/Eastern European city on EIU's quality of life index. It is also ranked as \"Europe's 7th most idyllic place to live\" by Forbes, and as the 9th most beautiful city in the world by UCityGuides. It is the highest ranked Central\/Eastern European city on Innovation Cities' Top 100 index. Budapest is home to the headquarters of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), and the first foreign office of the China Investment Promotion Agency (CIPA).","home":"http:\/\/budapest.com","population":1737000},"longitude":19.0407578,"airports_version":6,"timeZone_timestamp":"2020-01-26T02:03:51+00:00","timeZone":{"dstSavingsMins":60,"name":"Central European Time","id":"Europe\/Budapest","abbr":"CET","offsetMin":60},"translations_version":0,"locatedBy":"maps.google.com","airports":[],"airports_timestamp":"2019-03-24T17:37:01+00:00","localTime":{"dstActive":true,"timeZoneName":"Central European Summer Time","formatted":"7:38 PM","timeZoneAbbr":"CEST"},"nearByCities_version":2,"promotions":{"lastminutede_version":3,"lastminutede_timestamp":"2010-08-20T07:24:55+00:00","lastminutede":{}},"travelGuides_version":1,"nearByCities_timestamp":"2013-03-21T05:54:34+00:00","hotels":[{"provider":"hotel.info","name":"Clark Budapest","description":"The 4-star hotel with Danube view was built in 2017.

Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.3\u00a0million people, while its metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of nearly 2.0\u00a0million. The city has a temperate oceanic climate with warm summers and chilly winters. Prague has been a political, cultural, and economic centre of central Europe with waxing and waning fortunes during its 1,100 year existence. Founded during the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic and Renaissance eras, Prague was the seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. It was an important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian Empire and after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia. The city played major roles in the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, and in modern history generally as the principal conurbation in Bohemia and Moravia whose second city is Brno. Prague is home to a number of famous cultural attractions, many of which survived the violence and destruction of twentieth century Europe. Main attractions include the following: Prague Castle, the Charles Bridge, Old Town Square, the Jewish Quarter, the Lennon Wall, and Pet\u0159\u00edn hill. Since 1992, the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Prague boasts more than ten major museums, along with countless theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. A modern public transportation system connects the city. Also, Prague is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including the famous Charles University. Prague is classified as a Beta+ global city according to GaWC studies, comparable to Berlin, Rome, or Houston. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination, and the city receives more than 4.1\u00a0million international visitors annually, as of 2009. In 2011, Prague was the sixth most visited city in Europe.","home":"http:\/\/www.praha.eu\/","population":1262106},"longitude":14.4378005,"airports_version":6,"timeZone_timestamp":"2020-03-11T16:51:29+00:00","alt":[],"timeZone":{"dstSavingsMins":60,"name":"Central European Time","id":"Europe\/Prague","abbr":"CET","offsetMin":60},"translations_version":0,"locatedBy":"maps.google.com","airports":[],"airports_timestamp":"2019-03-25T20:47:49+00:00","localTime":{"dstActive":true,"timeZoneName":"Central European Summer Time","formatted":"4:06 PM","timeZoneAbbr":"CEST"},"nearByCities_version":2,"promotions":{"lastminutede_version":3,"lastminutede_timestamp":"2010-08-27T20:18:38+00:00","lastminutede":{}},"travelGuides_version":1,"nearByCities_timestamp":"2010-08-08T04:20:40+00:00","hotels":[{"provider":"hotel.info","name":"EA Hotel Tosca","description":"<p>A pleasant informal atmosphere and welcoming friendly staff are the great advantages of this hotel located in the centre of Prague, just few steps from the Wenceslas Square.
